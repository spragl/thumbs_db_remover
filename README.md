# thumbs_db_remover
Removes Thumbs.db recursively and then removes itself. Just copy to folder and run.

If you work in a Windows environment Thumbs.db files are likely popping up all over the place, and you play whack-a-mole removing them. With this small script you have a bigger hammer.

The only reason there is a zip file, is that it prevents you from selfdeleting your copy.

The theoretical correct approach to new software is to read the source code to check if it is secure, before running it. This is of course not practical, but in this case the script is only 16 lines. So I urge you to, for once, to read the code before running it.
